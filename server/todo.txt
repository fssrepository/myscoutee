Priority algorithm -> seems have been figured out
------------------
1) it's non paginated -> it's only grabbing the next X members to be invited to reach the capacity, and balance

Event list screen
-----------------
1) groupKey can be eventName + eventDate, and the list can show the members who were present over there

double rated profile list screen
--------------------------------
2) filter by gender, and whether we have met or not, that one can be opened for the priority
   event also, instead of a separate priority event list screen

event editor (event item editor is not needed for the time being, simplified version)
-----------
1) event.info is not in the list of eventItems, to add eventItems to an event is optional
2) the rule should be moved to event, instead if eventItem, the priority flag etc. also
3) event has status P (Pending), or T (timed out), eventItem has not
4) for optional eventItems, the members of event can request permission (like car, which can be accepted)
