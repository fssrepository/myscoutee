Priority event list screen
--------------------------
1) eventItem rule section should be moved to an inner list screen as filter bar
2) when rule filter bar gets saved, it will be saved to eventItem.rule also
3) when we set the rule filter, it filters out all the candidates, what we met (balanced, or user with same gender can be choosen)
4) we can rate man/women in that filtered list, and based on that the priority algorithm will work
5) the list is paginated, and shows, which members has been notified, and who is accepted and rejected, left etc.
6) on the event panel it's a new button next to the members (members is showing the list of active members only)
