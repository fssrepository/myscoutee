Priority algorithm -> seems have been figured out
------------------
1) it's non paginated -> it's only grabbing the next X members to be invited to reach the capacity, and balance

Event list screen
-----------------
1) groupKey can be eventName + eventDate, and the list can show the members who were present over there

double rated profile list screen
--------------------------------
2) filter by gender, and whether we have met or not, that one can be opened for the priority
   event also, instead of a separate priority event list screen

met + gender (man/woman/both)
not met (no gender parameter)

findProfile query (gender filter optional + if met, 
a) check whether any eventItems does exist, where currentUser and other profile are present)
- it's inside the query, but needs to make it optional for double rated

true/false slide, like on the rule page (priority, and show gender filter accordingly)

event editor (event item editor is not needed for the time being, simplified version)
-----------
1) event.info is not in the list of eventItems, to add eventItems to an event is optional
2) the rule should be moved to event, instead if eventItem, the priority flag etc. also
3) event has status P (Pending), or T (timed out), eventItem has not
4) for optional eventItems, the members of event can request permission (like car, which can be accepted)

New TODO:
1) az ujak listaja egy nagy kepernyo, nem egy lista, igy nem lehet atugorni embereket
2) Azok, akik legalabb 30 szavazatot kaptak, ne jelenjenek meg az ujak listajaban -> folyamat felgyorsitas
3) mongodb objectid instead of uuid, to make horizontal scaling
   redis db (stores uuid, objectid pairs), hence you can pass an objectid to the query

   rewrite url where the uuid is there
   shard key can't be geo spatial + only one shardKey does exist by collection (create shardIndex for e.g. _id)
   we have hash based and range based (ObjectId can be range based as it's a sequence like id, can be gte)
4) create multikey on eventItem.member, to query efficiently
5) qrcode -> when we have optional event, 
   while scanning showing which optional event he requested, it will be moved from eventItem to event
6) capacity
   (eventItem max. capacity should be less than the event max. capacity -> validate on the screen)
   max. capacity can't be more than 1000 (chat won't work also) -> validate on screen
   if priority has been set, it' changes the max. capacity to 20, if the value is greater than 20.
7) invitation will appear only in the chat, clicking on it, can can look into the event. 
   (it won't appear on the event list, until it's not accepted
8) clickable notification
9) new chat tab on event screen -first one
10) when you click on event (view/qrcode menu appears, not the eventItem list)
11) event, when you click on the panel, you have info (has edit button bottom left corner) + eventitems list + members list
12) if profile set its status to non-A/F, 
    its member status for all events will be set LD (late delete), D (delete), RD (reject delete), AD (access delete -> from All to friends only)
13) if admin leaves, the highest priority among admin and the certain member will get the admin role
14) lock/unlock event (isLocked???)
15) threadpool -> CTree-vel -> querying by 1000 records in a loop (maybe we don't need limit to make it simpler)
16) multislot/multistage event does not need to use BTree algorithm, only at rule.mutual inside the memebr list
17) close stage, might merge slots together, if min capacity hasn't been reached,
    and ask whether accept the date change (memberGrace) Invite next one
18) clone event or item inside the event or promotion, form will have a number of clones field
19) on recommendation screen, only one event will be shown by slot, and just the first stage, anyway disappears form the list
20) in the promotion editor, the number of available slots will appear and the number of booked one
    Cancel a whole slot, or decrease the number to make it partially. (notify the last booked ones for cancellation)
    assign admin/admins for each slot (from one of the team inside that group)
21) team
    you can create teams inside groups, and invite members (logical, only shown to you, if it's discreet)
    two types of view on member list screen (grouped by team or sorted by rate)
    you can invite members from outside (invitation link) or inside to a group or a team
    you can invite someone from outside and priority rate in the same way (filter bar, whether it has been invited from outside)

    Team{
      profiles,
      profileId (profileId is by group)
    }


    while creating an event, can select the whole team to invite
    team list is visible from group list screen also, while entering a group, you can change the view type to team.

    default team, nobody has been assigned to a team in there (name is "Unassigned") -> it's just shown on the member list screen, but hasn't been saved
22) On profile screen, you can switch between groups, look for other groups to join, create groups etc. (private/public)
23) activity/events/slots utvonalon lehet elerni addEvent
24) don't allow (put to wait list) other participant to join or invite until the ratio is not balanced (number of man/woman is equal)
    invite man or woman first
25) if event has the same range.tart and range.end => it will be shown in the same slot group on the screen,
    but as it hasn't been cloned, other ones won't update it, while editing.
26) assign admins to event (either me or different profiles)
27) if there are slots in different time the first slot is the most preferred members, if the member hasn't added any preference (prefer for, available for)
28) if max stage is not reached, algorithm invites to the next stage events based on selection mode
    rate/join menu on promotion
    event inside promotion has prefer and available menu  (opt for, favor for), available only for
29) save event as template
30) when adding to event either promotion or create new one, can select an already saved template.
31) The name has a sequence number to differenciate.
    (it does not have this number saved with the name it just appears in view, in multiple pages, how to handle??? - maybe on the view)
32) groupkey = stage + relevant slot
33) events inside the slot, can be handled independently, like cancel, delete, merge into other etc. 
    add event to a slot on the event editor
34) multislot and multi stage event coloured differently (event can be filtered by name also)
35) before approving an event, alert if there is any other event crossing the range
36) competition - ranking algorithm
    cross matrix (win, loose, draw scores) are predefined
    penalty/reward scores are predefined (matrix)

    roundrobin invitation for cross match
    scores are recalculated by stages

    for every time all the member score has been recalculated and saved to event table (Match finished)

    every match calculate score and if all score equal, than within equal add to a score an reversed order like score, first position +3, second +2, third +1
    sorsolas, add reverse order score also

    check whether harmonic mean is the same how football ranking works
37) multicast message

        // a normal event can cloned to a template and can be used for promotion later

39) groupKey (by 5km), range.start, dateUpdated - score is coloring
    mutual filter (friend's friend adertisements??)
40) recommendation list
    (small rounded profile picture (similar to select member for invitation at top bar) 
    left top corener of each panel, who has created)
41) if clone an event from recommendations tab, the user will be a member with Role M, status A.
    M (can invite members, or change the rule to priority etc.)
42) /recommend has been removed (can't recommend an event, will be confusing, data privacy)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
43) Last login date
44) if a group is discreet (Privacy), event is should be discreet also 
    (discreet level is member does not see invisible/visible/invisible_school/visible_school)
    in dating group the group is visible, but in business school will be shown
    invisible does mean, can't even rate or see new members, just wait for the admin to be invited
    when query User first time, it has got group info also, hence the school tab will disappear
45) school/car refactor (car join first optional event - check whether it's working)
46) stats 
47) findMemberByEvent (should be rate bar also) while saving on rate -> Member.score will be calculated 
    -> hence the orderby is based on Member.createdDate (join first) or Member.score (score should be calculated even Member, where the creator hasn't been rated yet)
48) EventGeneratorPromotionService implementation
