Prompt Confusions / Assumptions (2026-02-20)
============================================

1) Routing model
- Interpreted final requirement as: only Game is route-based; Chat/Invitations/Events/Hosting are popup-driven from user menu.

2) Profile editor entry
- Removed inline "Edit Profile" button to save space.
- Used top-right pencil icon + full header click as editor entry.

3) Exit location
- Removed header "Kilépés" button from menu panel.
- Moved logout action inside Profile Editor popup.

4) Demo login / user perspective
- Added environment toggle (loginEnabled=false by default).
- In disabled mode, app shows 12-user selector overlay on start.
- Selected user drives menu counters/content and game perspective.

5) Event/Invitation item text
- Changed accordion rows to short description + timeframe lines.
- Detailed logistics (cars/accommodation/accessories) moved to Event Editor popup.

6) Hosting interpretation
- Implemented Hosting as own hosted events (not supplies list).
- Supply assignment is represented in Event Editor sections (cars/accommodation/accessories).

7) Screenshot alignment
- Matched avatar emphasis + completion percent badges + 3-line header text.
- Kept red activity counter on avatar top-right and moved completion indicator to bottom overlay pill.
- Kept visual style close but not pixel-perfect due missing exact font/assets from design source.

8) Data recency / document conflict
- Some plan texts overlap with older versions.
- Used latest profile/event requirements and prioritized mobile-usable accordion structure.
