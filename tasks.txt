now:
1) check event gear icon -> remove (filters will be added later)
2) check event game/new gear icon -> figure out the basic filters - age etc. - recommended people here also
3) add chat menu at the top (chat icon) -> if you accept invitation, then it goes to event tab
4) expose the url of random event generation
5) replace the notification icon with calendar icon
6) age range filter on games non_rate screen

cron job for random generator + chat (event) leave (disable friends only for the time being)

future:

1) game kepernyo
    a) double_rate az 5. icon (filter on new, matched, met)
    b) add filter to 4. icon (filter on met or new)
