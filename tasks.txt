now:
1) check event gear icon -> remove (filters will be added later)
2) check event game/new gear icon -> figure out the basic filters - age etc. - recommended people here also
3) expose the url of random event generation
4) age range filter on games non_rate screen

cron job for random generator + chat (event) leave (disable friends only for the time being)

bugs:
-----

1) changing image, is not saved
2) on profile clicking on image, should show all the 3 images (1th one third of the panel => first ikmage, second third => second image)
3) update image next tim is forbidden
4) at new profile the form is not loading
5) event paging not working
6) progress bar coloring - material style has been changed -> should be bug fixed
