# Measurement method


- Local active and archived `.codex` histories are the primary execution evidence. All 649 JSONL files were inventoried, including split conversations; the history database was checked for additional coverage. Local retained conversations start on July 22, while account daily records reach February 4.
- Reuse the existing production audit method: unique response IDs when available; positive cumulative-counter differences for older records; unchanged counters contribute nothing; an initial partial counter or reset contributes only its recorded last response. Approval-review histories are not counted as extra user work. Cached input is inside input; reasoning output is inside output.
- Reuse the frozen September 12 film/book audit without changing its 14 phase totals: **2.295 billion logged tokens**, including the separately identified product campaign. Its cutoff excludes that audit's own work. Those tokens are reserved before allocating other account activity, so they are not counted twice.
- For other tasks, date/topic evidence from original commits and conversation requests supplies allocation weights. The daily account totals are control totals. Task splits remain estimates, particularly for mixed conversations and work before local history retention. Unrelated or unsupported activity remains unassigned. 189.2 M tokens for tasks without isolated daily evidence are comparable-task estimates reserved from the unassigned account balance; their daily attribution is unavailable.
- Active time follows the existing audit's union of recorded task intervals, so overlapping root intervals are not added twice. It includes tool execution and waiting within active tasks and is not a human timesheet. Missing AI timing is estimated from comparable observed work. Manual legacy work has no time estimate; archive dates do not establish its original development period. Frozen creative tasks also retain their 15–30 minute joint-window estimates.
- Historical start/finish fields describe when the work happened. GitHub issue creation/closure dates describe this retrospective import. A historical Done record is evidence of delivered work, not a claim that the current software was retested during import.
- Logged model/effort values take precedence. When missing, the creator's stated preference for the strongest available Codex model is combined with release dates: GPT-5.3-Codex from February 5, GPT-5.4 from March 5, GPT-5.5 from April 23, GPT-5.6 Sol from July 9, GPT-6 Astra from September 3. These are explicitly estimated selections; quota-driven fallbacks and rollout timing may differ. Missing reasoning effort remains unrecorded.
- USD estimates use [OpenAI's Standard API rates](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing), valued on 2026-10-01, for input, cached input, cache writes when observed, and output. Missing token mix is estimated from observed sessions. This standardized short-context comparison excludes Fast/Ultrafast, long-context and regional uplifts, subscription charging, infrastructure, and image/video/TTS-provider credits. It is not historical billing reconciliation.

Model date sources: [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/), [GPT-5.4](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/), [GPT-5.5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-5/), [GPT-5.6](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-6/), [GPT-6 Astra](https://openai.com/index/safety-overview-gpt-6-astra/).


- Four independent Projects separate MyScoutee, the manually developed legacy archive, e-kozig and mathematical research. Shared account tokens are allocated once across all four; a Project total is never an additional account total. Historical legacy AI usage is unverified and left blank. The current AI-assisted Project-administration task is measured separately. A final shared maintenance-run measurement is apportioned by snapshot ownership; its overlap with MSC-108 is removed and its net allocation uses the unassigned account allowance, without exact daily billing reconciliation.
- Mathematical experiments and videos do not establish a solution of the continuous Navier–Stokes problem. The claim withdrawal is a first-class task.

## MSC-113 measurement boundary

The completed rating implementation/QA turn records 16,498,993 tokens and
0.7463375 hours from 2026-10-01T01:27:06.471Z to 2026-10-01T02:11:53.286Z.
Use unique response IDs; cached input is within input and reasoning is within
output. The subsequent commit/Project/roadmap administration is excluded.
The frozen 2026-10-01 rate card gives a $23.80 Standard API equivalent estimate,
not an invoice. Backend/frontend snapshots share one task measurement; there
is no observed per-repository split, so their copies must not be added together.

The historical account control and September-30 daily heatmap remain unchanged.
This independently recorded October-1 task is listed under
`post_control_task_usage`; Project/task totals include it once. It is not
subtracted from the older unassigned-account allowance or represented as a new
account-wide daily measurement. Final consolidated commit mappings are retained
in the canonical roadmap backup to avoid self-referential source commit hashes.
